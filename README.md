This is a project where I showcase my proficiency in Javascript. The webpage geral.html loads the Brazilian map using the leaflet library.

There are two main html pages: geral.html and pv.html

In geral.html the map contains the results of the 2014 presidency elections. Each city ir colored according to the most voted party.

In pv.html the map is  colored according to the average of votes to the PV party for each city compared to the national average. In case the city vote average is
50% bigger than the national average, the color will be stronger. If the average is 50% smaller, the color will be weaker. Otherwise it will receive the standard color.
